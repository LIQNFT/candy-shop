# Candy Shop

**IN BETA**

Candy Shop is a JavaScript library that allows DAOs, NFT projects and anyone to create an NFT marketplace on Solana in minutes!

Drawing inspiration from Project Serum’s mission to accelerate Solana’s on-chain trading infrastructure, Candy Shop aspires to do the same for the Solana NFT marketplace ecosystem.

Candy Shop provides an easy to integrate marketplace protocol & toolset with a full suite of data endpoints and command APIs to help  users deliver a simplistic, seamless and efficient NFT marketplace experience. For different marketplace hosting options, please refer to [this doc](Market.md)

Key features:
* **Simple Integration.** Integrate marketplace features into your website easily with Candy Shop SDK - your marketplace could be fully operational within a few minutes. 
* **Seamless User Experience.** The commands and data endpoints have been designed in a way to simplify user journey and provide a seamless experience for browsing, buying and selling NFTs on your in-house marketplace.
* **Give More, Earn More.** Users save on transaction fees when they transact on your Candy Shop marketplace, and you will also earn 20% of the 1% transaction fee. 
* **Candy Shop Network.** Standardized implementation allows you to import other Candy Shop NFT listings directly onto your marketplace or vice versa - creating a network effect of listings for maximum traffic flow
* **Transparency.** Candy Shop is an open source and on-chain protocol, providing your community with full transparency on what is happening behind the scene for your marketplace.

## For Contributors

Candy Shop is built with TSDX, which scaffolds the library inside `/src`, and also sets up a [Parcel-based](https://parceljs.org) playground for it inside `/example`.

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run the example inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

The default example imports and live reloads whatever is in `/dist`, so if you are seeing an out of date component, make sure TSDX is running in watch mode like we recommend above. **No symlinking required**, we use [Parcel's aliasing](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#aliases).

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
