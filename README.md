## Intro

Candy Shop is a JavaScript library that allows DAOs, NFT projects and anyone to create an NFT marketplace on Solana in minutes!

Drawing inspiration from Project Serum’s mission to accelerate Solana’s on-chain trading infrastructure, Candy Shop aspires to do the same for the Solana NFT marketplace ecosystem.

Candy Shop provides an easy to integrate marketplace protocol & toolset with a full suite of data endpoints and command APIs to help users deliver a simplistic, seamless and efficient NFT marketplace experience. For different marketplace hosting options, please refer to [this doc](Market.md)

  - your mainnet connection node url (default is https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net/)
- `connectionConfig: object`
  - your mainnet connection node url configuration

## Customize Your Marketplace

`@liqnft/candy-shop-sdk` that inside `@liqnft/candy-shop`, allows you to ship your own custom marketplace with desired UI by calling methods below.

### How to use sdk

```ts
import { CandyShop } from '@liqnft/candy-shop-sdk';
// Fetch orders
candyShop.getOrders();

// Buy
candyShop.buy();

// Sell
candyShop.sell();

// Cancel sell order
candyShop.cancel();

// Get statistics
candyShop.getStats();

// Get transactions
candyShop.getTransactions();
```

## Embedded UI Usages

We provide a few built-in UI to speed up building your market place without crafting the styles. If you want to have your own styles, please refer to [Customize Your Marketplace](#customize-your-marketplace) section that just using the sdk to perform the marketplace functions.

### Show Orders and Buy Interface

Show the NFTs that are for sale and allow users to connect their wallet and buy them.

```ts
import { Orders } from '@liqnft/candy-shop';

<Orders
  wallet={wallet}
  candyShop={candyShop}
  walletConnectComponent={<WalletMultiButton />}
/>;
```

#### Additional params:

- `filters: Array<{ name: string, identifier: number}>`
  - You can let users filter by NFT collection by specifying the filters parameter. Name is the label shown in the filter box. Identifier is the unique NFT collection identifier, which you can get by whitelisting an NFT collection in My Shop or by using the getIdentifier helper method in the Candy Shop library
- `identifiers: Array<number>`
  - By default, only show orders from certain NFT collections. Takes an array of identifiers.
- `url: string`
  - When user clicks on an NFT order, direct user to a new route instead of opening a buy NFT modal. Route should be in form of `/my-route/:tokenMint` where `:tokenMint` will be replaced by the NFT token mint

### Show Sell Interface

Show sell interface that allows users to connect their wallet and list their NFTs for sale.

```ts
import { Sell } from '@liqnft/candy-shop';

<Sell
  wallet={wallet}
  candyShop={candyShop}
  walletConnectComponent={<WalletMultiButton />}
/>;
```

### Show Stats

Show key stats about your collection

```ts
import { Stats } from '@liqnft/candy-shop';

<Stat
  candyShop={candyShop}
  title={'Marketplace'}
  description={
    'Candy Shop is an open source on-chain protocol that empowers DAOs, NFT projects and anyone interested in creating an NFT marketplace to do so within minutes!'
  }
/>;
```

### Buy Single NFT Interface

Show buy interface for a single NFT order. This component can be used by specifying the `url` param to the Orders component. Token mint can be parsed from the URL and inserted into the OrderDetail component.

```ts
import { OrderDetail } from '@liqnft/candy-shop';

<OrderDetail
  tokenMint={'WfL9fAggBMHmjvBEu1v53fQkRmB3Cn4giJSSQxVSC5W'} // token mint of the NFT
  backUrl={'/'} // will redirect to this route after sale is completed
  candyShop={candyShop}
  walletConnectComponent={<WalletMultiButton />}
  wallet={wallet}
/>;
```

## ⚠️ Solana Transaction Size Limit ⚠️

For Candy Shops that use a SPL token as the payment currency, if any NFT's are listed on it that have 4 creators or more, users trying to buy those NFT's will not be able to successfully do so. This is because in this case, the Solana transaction size becomes too large, exceeding the current Solana transaction size limit. Workarounds for this issue are actively being looked into.

## Contribute to Candy Shop

We're welcoming to receive any contribution for candy-shop! Feel free to open a PR can request LIQNFT team to review.

Following is some set up you might need to know before building up together.

### Prerequisite

Install Node (above 14.17.x), NPM, Yarn

### Launch example

Installing & Building all required packages by `setup.sh`

Use `setup.sh` in root folder.
```bash
# run chmod when executing it first time
chmod 755 setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

In root folder, hosting dist from example at `localhost:1234`

```bash
yarn start
```

### Clean node_modules for clean building

In root folder

```bash
yarn clean:all
```

We also have individual clean up scripts provided in root's package.json.
### Symbolic link between ui and sdk

Currently, `core/ui` depends on the published package from `core/sdk`, if development both locally, we need to use symbolic link to let `core/ui` use the live changes from `core/sdk`.

Use `workspace_symbolic_link.sh` in root folder.
- Make sure you've built the `core/sdk` before linking.
```bash
# run chmod when executing it first time
chmod 755 workspace_symbolic_link.sh
./workspace_symbolic_link.sh
```

It should show yarn link success in terminal.
```bash
success Using linked package for "@liqnft/candy-shop-sdk".
```

#### How to reflect the changes after linked

Always build sdk at first.

1. In `core/sdk`

```bash
yarn build
```
2. In `core/ui`

```bash
yarn build
```
3. In root folder
```bash
yarn build
```

If you're using `yarn start` in root folder while development, it will automatically detect the changes from `core/ui` once you performed the `yarn build` under the `core/ui`.

### Formatting

In root folder

```bash
yarn format:fix
```

### Branch Naming

To help reviewers differentiate the PR, define your dev branch with module name like following.

branch: **module/descriptive-short-sentence** (lowercase)

e.g. `ui/update-button-styles`, `core/refactor-backend-api`, etc.
| Branch Type | Purpose  
| ---------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| core | Changes made for files across in `src/core`  
| sdk | Changes particularly for `src/core/sdk`  
| ui | Changes particularly for `src/core/ui`  
| cli | Changes particularly for `src/core/cli`  
| chore | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries  
| doc | Documentation only changes
